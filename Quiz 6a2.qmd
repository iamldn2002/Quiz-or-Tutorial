# Assuming 'german_cities' is a vector containing city names. If it's a column in a data frame, adjust accordingly.
german_cities <- c("Berlin", "Hamburg", "Munich", "Cologne", "Frankfurt", "Rostock") # Example vector

specified_cities <- c("Berlin", "Hamburg", "Munich", "Cologne", "Frankfurt", "Rostock")

# Test 1: Correctness of Cities
test_that("All cities are correct", {

})

# Test 2: Completeness of List
test_that("All specified cities are present", {
  expect_true(all(specified_cities %in% german_cities))
})

# Test 3: Uniqueness of Entries
test_that("Each city is unique", {
  expect_true(length(german_cities) == length(unique(german_cities)))
